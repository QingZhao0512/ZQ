title: About me
---

Hello, I am **Qing Zhao**, with the pronunciation `ching`.😁 Hailing from China, I am currently a doctoral student specializing in nursing and public health. My research interests primarily focus on measuring and enhancing the quality of primary healthcare services. Simultaneously, I am also an enthusiastic self-learner in programming.

In terms of pronouns, please use **she/her/hers** when referring to me.🍉

20240810 update: This blog remains too emotional and narrative-focused. I need to shift towards more analytical writing. I will be transitioning to that style soon and will post the new link here!
