Hello, I am **Qing Zhao**, with the pronunciation `ching`.😁 Hailing from China, I am currently a doctoral student specializing in nursing and public health. Among my passions are savoring delicious meals, indulging in rejuvenating slumber, acquiring knowledge, and engaging in creative endeavors. 

My research interests primarily focus on measuring and enhancing the quality of primary healthcare services. Simultaneously, I am also an enthusiastic self-learner in the realm of programming.
