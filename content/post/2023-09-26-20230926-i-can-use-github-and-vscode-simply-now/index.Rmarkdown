Recently, my Python course has finished. Although it was an introductory course, teacher provided insightful explanations, guided us through **the learning path**, and offered **interactive learning materials**(such as .ipynb notebooks). I am very satisfied with it and have learned a lot.

Today, I finally managed to use Python and GitHub projects. I utilized the project at [weibo-crawler](https://github.com/dataabc/weibo-crawler) and successfully retrieved Weibo records for 迪丽热巴. It was the project's default setting and I'm not her fan 😊.

Learning bit by bit\~⛳

```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, paged.print=TRUE}
# 加载rio包
library(rio)


# 读取文件
data <- import("D:/career/data/weibo-crawler-master/weibo/Dear-迪丽热巴/1669879400.csv", encoding = "UTF-8")



print(data)






```
