Recently, I have grown increasingly aware that the development of productivity and the emergence of new technologies can profoundly alter the current reality. In the field of health service research that I am engaged in, it essentially remains a specific realm within the domain of social sciences, specifically in medicine. Social sciences are more focused on interpreting the world rather than directly propelling transformation.

Not long ago, I shared a dinner with Dr. Luo, a doctoral candidate from the School of Public Health at New York University. She, too, expressed her perplexity about the realm of implementation science. She mentioned that she had taken some courses from business schools and felt that implementation science might resemble organizational behavior in business schools, the difference being that the domains of medicine and business have yet to be integrated, thus leading us to explore ideas that have already been studied extensively in the business school context.

While I still lean away from delving extensively into exhaustive reviews and behavioral research, I am also puzzled by my lack of concrete technical skills. Perhaps, in the pursuit of finding a point of entry, the field of computer science might provide some assistance. After all, computer science stands as a discipline independent of physical hardware requirements, unlike, for example, a medical student who necessitates access to hospital facilities, surgical tools, and real-world clinical scenarios. The mastery of data analysis skills could indeed find more meaningful application within the context of social sciences.
