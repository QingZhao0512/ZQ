The new semester has begun. My new roommates are really friendly and I enjoy my new life here.

The content of the doctoral program is generally not very rewarding, so I plan to audit courses in master's data analysis, which mainly include Python, data mining, Bayesian methodology, etc. I hope to gain more knowledge from this. Recently, I found a guitar teacher, and the cost is a bit high for me, but I really want to learn the guitar well. Another very important task during my doctoral studies is to continuously improve my English skills.



Life is long. No need to rush.😄
