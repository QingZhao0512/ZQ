Recently, I am working on developing a Twitter bot dedicated to dissemination of China implementation science research [@ImpSciBot](https://twitter.com/ImpSciBot)
. Specifically, this bot will run a Python script designed to retrieve articles published by Chinese researchers on PubMed daily, concerning implementation science. These articles will be assessed using Large Language model (chatgpt) to confirm their relevance to the field. Once validated, the bot will automatically tweet these findings.

The motivation behind creating this bot arises from a noticeable gap on Twitter, where scholars in computer science and social science frequently share their work, whereas those in the health sector, particularly from China, do so far less frequently. This platform aims to spotlight the contributions of Chinese researchers in implementation science to a global audience.

This project has also served as an excellent opportunity for me to enhance my Python coding skills, and I anticipate completing it within the next few days. Following this, I plan to develop a similar bot with low marginal costs for Chinese nursing research, further expanding the reach of vital scientific information.
